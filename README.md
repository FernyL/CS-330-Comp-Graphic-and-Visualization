# How do I approach designing software?

For my approach to designing software, first I seek out any requirements and then I follow a step by step plan. I ensure that my work is adaptable, manageable, and organized. This project helped me craft quite a few design skills such as transforming 3D shapes, navigating through the 3D scene with camera movement linked to input devices, applying texture to objects, and applying lighting to the 3D scene. For this project, I applied a iterative design approach as I began with creating the 3D shapes and building upon that until I reached the end result.
