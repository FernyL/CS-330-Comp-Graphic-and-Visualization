# How do I approach designing software?

For my approach to designing software, first I seek out any requirements and then I follow a step by step plan. I ensure that my work is adaptable, manageable, and organized. This project helped me craft quite a few design skills such as transforming 3D shapes, navigating through the 3D scene with camera movement linked to input devices, applying texture to objects, and applying lighting to the 3D scene. For this project, I applied a bottom-up design approach as I began with creating the 3D shapes and building upon that piece by piece until I reached the end result.

# How do I approach developing programs?

When it comes to developing programs, I use iterative design as I write the code in sections with each section building upon the previous sections. I began this projects program by building functions to create/transform the 3D shapes which then led to creating functions to navigate through the 3D scene by setting up the mouse and keyboard input devices to move in different directions through the scene and changing the camera's orientation. From here I built a function to add texture to different objects in the scene and eventually added lighting to the scene through another function which led to the completion of the project.   

# How can computer science help me in reaching my goals? How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational/professional pathway?

Computer science can help me reach my goals by giving me the skills required to design and develop the programs required to solve problems in the tech world and enhance the user experience. Computational graphics and visualization gives me the knowledge and skills that can be applied to my future educational/professional pathways by giving me practice with iterative design and giving me knowledge/skills for video game development or virtual reality by building immersive and beautiful scenery if I choose to go down that path.
