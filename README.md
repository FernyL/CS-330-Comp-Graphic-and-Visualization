# How do I approach designing software?

For my approach to designing software, first I seek out any requirements and then I follow a step by step plan. I ensure that my work is adaptable, manageable, and organized. This project helped me craft quite a few design skills such as transforming 3D shapes, navigating through the 3D scene with camera movement linked to input devices, applying texture to objects, and applying lighting to the 3D scene. For this project, I applied a bottom-up design approach as I began with creating the 3D shapes and building upon that piece by piece until I reached the end result.

# How do I approach developing programs?

When it comes to developing programs, I use iterative design as I write the code in sections with each section building upon the previous sections. I began this projects program by building functions to create/transform the 3D shapes which then led to creating functions to navigate through the 3D scene by setting up the mouse and keyboard input devices to move in different directions through the scene and changing the camera's orientation. From here I built a function to add texture to different objects in the scene and eventually added lighting to the scene through another function which led to the completion of the project.
